\========================================================================

\*\*Tolerance allowance\*\*

In test cases where a change in an attribute value is tested over time, it is permitted for the devices involved in the test to be within a tolerance of Â±15% of the expected time.

Also, when reading attributes representing a color value, they may deviate from the value provided in a related command due to rounding effects in DUT, inaccuracies during a transition (Â±15% value tolerance allowed), or due to clipping if the value provided in the command is outside the support range of the DUT.

Functional.

\##### [](#\_purpose\_209)Purpose

This test case verifies the support of non-global attributes of the Mode Select Cluster cluster client.

This test case evaluates only attributes which are:

1\. Defined in the Matter spec for Mode Select Cluster cluster client.

2\. Required or just usable for the functionality of the DUT (Mode Select Cluster cluster client).

A mandatory attribute on server side does not mean that the support of this attribute is required on client side.

The requirement of supporting an attribute on client side is either driven by the device type or is a decision by the DUT manufacturer.

In this test, the PICS notation MOD.C.AM-READ represents the list of non-global attributes that are specified as being mandatory on client side and relevant for the DUT.

Similarly, the PICS notation MOD.C.AO-READ represents the list of non-global attributes that are specified as being optional on client side.

MOD.C.AM-WRITE and MOD.C.AO-WRITE are similar to MOD.C.AM-READ and MOD.C.AO-READ, but additional they are marked as writeable in the cluster spec and the the DUTs supports writing to these attributes.

After the elimination of fault cause(s), the attribute value should be empty. This value may be subscribed. |

| 8   | 11.11.7.7 | DGGEN.S.A0006(ActiveRadioFaults) | TH reads ActiveRadioFaults attribute value from DUT. Subscription is possible for this attribute. | When operational, the attribute response should be empty. But when a radio fault occurs, the return attribute value must match the value listed in the RadioFault ENUM table. 11.11.6.2. After the elimination of fault cause(s), the attribute value should be empty. This value may be subscribed. |

| 9   | 11.11.7.8 | DGGEN.S.A0007(ActiveNetworkFaults) | TH reads ActiveNetworkFaults attribute value from DUT. Subscription is possible for this attribute. | When operational, the attribute response should be empty. But when a network fault occurs, the return attribute value must match the value listed in the NetworkFault ENUM table 11.11.6.3. After the elimination of fault cause(s), the attribute value should be empty. This value may be subscribed. |

| 10  | 11.11.7.9 | DGGEN.S.A0008(TestEventTriggersEnabled) | TH reads TestEventTriggersEnabled attribute value. If this value is set True, then a certain test mode will be performed (or triggered) according to pre-provisioned client and server test mode. | Indicates that node is configured for test event triggers. When configured TRUE, Node has been configured with one or more test event triggers by virtue of the internally programmed non zero EnableKey value. |

\### [](#\_testing\_tolerances)134.1. Testing tolerances

In test cases where a change in an attribute value is tested over time, it is permitted for the devices involved in the test to be within a tolerance of Â±15% of the expected value. As such, these test cases indicate that the attribute value must be approximately equal to an expected value, to which the Â±15% tolerance should then be applied. All other attribute values presented are expected to be exact.

\### [](#\_test\_steps\_manipulating\_attributes)134.2. Test steps manipulating attributes

In test case steps that require more than one attribute to be manipulated (e.g. read), the tester may decide whether it is appropriate or practical to send a single attribute manipulation command, containing multiple attributes, or multiple attribute manipulation commands, each containing a single attribute. The test case is designed to verify the behavior of the device supporting the attribute rather that verifying the attribute manipulation command in question.

\##### [](#\_category\_271)Category

Functional

\##### [](#\_purpose\_277)Purpose

This test case verifies the primary functionality of the Scenes cluster server.

This test case requires an \_application configuration\_, \_AC\_, to be set on the device in order to create a scene. An \_AC\_ is essentially a set of cluster attribute settings which affect the scene and is dependent on the application clusters supported on the server device. When the test calls for a specific \_ACi\_ it is up to the tester to manipulate the attributes on the DUT according to the supported clusters such that each \_ACi\_ is unique.

Since Scenes are using concepts from the Groups cluster, some commands from the Groups cluster are used in this test, e.g. \_AddGroup\_, \_AddGroupResponse\_ and \_RemoveAllGroups\_.

\##### [](#\_category\_272)Category

Functional

\##### [](#\_purpose\_278)Purpose

This test case verifies the secondary functionality of the Scenes cluster server.

This test case requires an \_application configuration\_, \_AC\_, to be set on the device in order to create a scene. An \_AC\_ is essentially a set of cluster attribute settings which affect the scene and is dependent on the application clusters supported on the server device. When the test calls for a specific \_ACi\_ it is up to the tester to manipulate the attributes on the DUT according to the supported clusters such that each \_ACi\_ is unique.

This test case requires one group to be configured on the device, \_G1\_. Before the test, the tester should evaluate PIXIT items PIXIT.G.01 and PIXIT.G.02 and select \_G1\_ accordingly so that the group IDs are different to those of PIXIT.G.02. If the device pre-configures all its groups such that a new group cannot be added, then \_G1\_ needs to be taken from group list of PIXIT.G.02.
